App Starter
==========

A starter theme for building mobile-friendly web apps.

This is brand-new, pre-beta code. I built this as the starting point for something else I am working on. If you find something that doesn't work or could be improved please create a new issue and/ or pull request.




Note About Foundation Assets
============================
I have included all Foundation SASS and JS components as individual files.  The are all combined and minfied into the single CSS and JS files that are actually loaded by WordPress. A good first step when using this theme would be to get rid of all of the things you don't need.
